  alternative to **describe-key**.

  minibuffer
- Added key bindings **C-/** and **C-?** (resp. undo and redo) as minibuffer
  input key bindings

  (still the default), mouse selection clipboard or both.
- Added a **--list-instances** command line flag, allowing to list current
  running instances.
- Passing an empty string to the **--instance** command line flag will generate

- Added a **raise-instance** command, to raise the current window of another
  webmacs instance.

## Changed

- **C-h c** is now bound to **describe-key-briefly** instead of

  with Emacs default keybindings.

## [0.7] - 2018-09-20

### Fixed

- Fix refreshing buffer count in the minibuffer right label when a buffer is
  closed.
- Fix reviving buffers that were not loaded (after restoring a session).
- Fix hinting urls in iframes when opening in a new buffer.
- Fixed support for Qt 5.7
- Fixed requiring escaping of raw % signs in custom webjumps.
- Fixed zoom-normal was bound to **0** instead of **=**.

### Added

- Added the **switch-buffer-current-color** variable that customize the color of
  the current buffer row in the **switch-buffer** displayed list. The color
  defaults to a light blue. Set to an empty string to get the old behavior (no
  specific color).
- **switch-buffer** now list buffers using the internal buffer order.
- Buffers now have numbers and the current buffer number is displayed in the
  minibuffer right label as well as in the **switch-buffer** and
  **switch-recent-buffer** lists.
- **M-n** and **M-p** are bound respectively to the new commands **next-buffer**
  and **previous-buffer**, allowing to cycle through buffers.
- **M-<**, **M->**, **C-v**, **M-v** bindings in the minibuffer lists for
  navigation.
- New commands and bindings added to copy stuff to clipboard.
  **copy-current-link** bound to **c c**, **copy-current-buffer-title** bound to
  **c t**, and copy-current-buffer-url bound to **c u** (all in the webbuffer
  keymap)
- Added a new method for hinting: alphabet. This allow to navigate only using
  the home row keys, and without using Enter. Can be enabled by setting the
  new variable **hint-method** to "alphabet".
- Added a new variable **hint-alphabet-characters** to specify which characters
  to use with the alphabet hinting.
- Added a new variable **hint-node-style** to change the style of the hint div
  nodes.
- Added a **close-buffer-close-window** variable to be able to close a window
  when a buffer is closed.
- **C-g** in webbuffer is now bound to **buffer-escape** instead of
  **buffer-unselect**, which does the same thing and send the Escape too (which
  closes popup and other things).
- Added two variables, **default-download-dir** and
  **keep-temporary-download-dir**.

### Changed

- The old **switch-buffer** behavior is now offered with the
  **switch-recent-buffer** command. The latter is now bound to **C-x b** and
  **C-x C-b** so there is no visible change using those keybindings.
- The **c** (copy-link) binding is now available using **c l** (think about Copy
  Link).
- The css style of the hints has been changed. If you prefer the old style, just
  set the **hint-node-style** variable to {"background": "red", "color":
  "white"}.
- The **go-to** command (bounds to **g**) now set the current url in the
  minibuffer input and select it.
- The **go-to-selected-url** and **go-to-selected-url-new-buffer** commands are
  renamed to **go-to-alternate-url** and **go-to-alternate-url-new-buffer**.
  Also they do not anymore select the current url, but only set the cursor at
  the end of the url.

  **webmacs.keymaps.keymap()** (respectively with the argument "global",
  "webbuffer" and "webcontent-edit").
- loading page information is now displayed in the minibuffer right label, using

### Fixed

## [0.4] - 2018-05-04

### Fixed

- Fixed closing buffer in some circumstances using C-k from the
  switch-buffer command.
- Improved position of the minibuffer popup, removing empty pixels
  between the popup and the input.
- Fixed using i-search when caret browsing is enabled
- improve using multiple views, fixing a lot of bugs around that (keyboard
  focus lost, crash using switch-buffer on an already displayed buffer, ...)

### Changed

- **breaking change**. The completion\_fn argument in define\_webjump has
  changed, see the documentation about that.
- improved webjump completions in multiple ways.
- switching buffers now tries its best to keep the current scroll and cursor
  position, so that coming back to a previous buffer feels more natural. This
  is in part implemented by keeping one internal qt webengineview per buffer.
- improved the visibility of the current view when there are multiple
  views. There is now a border on each side of the view, with one pixel red and
  one black.

- added two variables to customize how webmacs starts: **home-page** and
  **home-page-in-new-window**.
- added a command to restore previous session (windows and buffers),
  **restore-session**.
- Under X11, if the --instance is passed at the command line, the
  WM_CLASS property is set to "webmacs-{instance}".
- added basic support for multiple windows. New commands added: **make-window**,
  **other-window**, **close-window**, **close-other-window**.
- saving and restoring web views in session
- saving and restoring window position and state in session
- added a variable **webview-stylesheet** to customize the above view style.
- added a command **buffer-unselect** to clear selection in the current buffer.
- bound **buffer-unselect** to **C-g** in the webbuffer keymap.

## [0.3]

### Added

- added python dependency *pygments* to render source code.
- added a command line flag **--instance** to run named instances of webmacs

### Fixed

- If webmacs has crashed, the local socket used for ipc is now cleaned, so other
  commands for this webmacs instance are forwarded and does not anymore create a
  new instance.
- do not set the webbuffer active keymap as the current local keymap if the
  minibuffer input is currently opened.


## [0.2]

The distinction between 0.1 and 0.2 version is not clear unfortunately - patches
were just going in the main git branch. To highlight some features, let's start
the version 0.2 from the commit cb0cea39eaab6a01ee74ca16261c2b467b4af5a3.

- added new variable **webjump-default**
- better prompt completion
- added information in the minibuffer
- added new variable **minibuffer-right-label** for the format of the displayed
  information in the minibuffer
- support for bookmarks (see **bookmark-add** and **bookmark-open** commands,
  bound to respectively **M** and **m** in the webbuffer keymap).
- support for zoom and text zoom. See the **zoom-\*** and **text-zoom-\***
  commands.

### Fixed

- fixed segfault with some graphic cards
- retrieving ad-block rules and compiling them is now done in a thread, so
  webmacs is not slow at startup anymore
- added a warning when using opengl with the nouveau driver.
- default qt shortcuts in webviews are removed, so webmacs bindings are working
  without side-effect anymore (e.g., C-a was sometimes selecting the text)

  undo redo works better and it also mostly works in contenteditable fields
